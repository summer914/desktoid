Desktoid is intended to connect your Android to any mainstream remote desktop.

Currently only RDP (Terminal Services) is being worked on, but eventually I hope to add in options for VNC, NX and others.

**2009/07/24 UPDATE**:
> I started writing this app because I worked at Google and was given a gift Android and thought it would be a cool app for the company. Google laid me off (for fictitious reasons) on 1/22 and shortly after that I sold my gift Android. Ever since the bastards laid me off I have had **no** desire to contribute to the Android community, especially all by myself as just a hobby (I already have enough hobbies and other distractions).  That said, THIS PROJECT IS STILL OPEN TO CONTRIBUTORS! By all means, if you want to see this app come to fruition, please request access! I will be glad to converse about the existing code and contribute where I can (again, I don't have a device or care to pay for one, so I would only be able to contribute using the emulator).<br>
<blockquote>As for my <b>2009/01/08</b> update, I think the code was lost when the bastards confiscated my laptop. It is possible but very unlikely that I have a copy of the updated code.<br>
I do have some nifty logos for Desktoid! :)</blockquote>

<b>2009/01/08 UPDATE</b>:<br>
<blockquote>My current Desktoid.interim code is not yet ready to be uploaded, but in it I have successfully been able to make a connection to an RDP server. I want to resolve the "license" issue before I am ready to check in.</blockquote>

properJavaRDP-1.1 is being used as the basis of the RDP feature. I will need to find an appropriate open java VNC and NX library.<br>
